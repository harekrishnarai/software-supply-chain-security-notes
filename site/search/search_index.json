SBOMs provide transparency and traceability throughout the supply chain.  3. **Threat Modeling**: A systematic approach to identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities in the software supply chain, enabling organizations to prioritize security measures based on risk assessment.  4. **Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)**: Integration of security practices throughout the development process, from design to deployment and maintenance.  5. **Artifact Provenance**: Verifiable records of where, when, and how software components were built, providing evidence of the integrity and authenticity of artifacts.  6. **Secure Build and CI/CD Systems**: Tools and processes that ensure the integrity of build environments and automation systems used to compile, test, and deploy code.  7. **Trust Distribution and Verification**: Mechanisms for establishing and verifying trust in software components and their sources, often using cryptographic signatures.

Key Anomaly Indicators  - **Unusual commit timing**: Commits outside normal working hours or patterns - **Atypical file modifications**: Changes to critical files not normally modified - **Build process deviations**: Unexpected build steps or connections - **Dependency anomalies**: Unusual updates or version changes - **Runtime behavior shifts**: New network connections or resource access patterns  Advanced Anomaly Detection Techniques <ul> <li>Unsupervised Learning: Models that identify unusual patterns without predefined labels</li> <li>One-class Classification: Learning what \"normal\" is and detecting deviations</li> <li>Graph-based Analysis: Monitoring relationships between entities in the supply chain</li> <li>Process Mining: Analyzing process execution traces for unusual patterns</li> <li>Transfer Learning: Applying knowledge from known attacks to detect similar patterns</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tools/monitoring/#implementation-example-build-behavior-anomaly-detection","title":"Implementation Example: Build Behavior Anomaly Detection","text":"<pre><code># Example Python code for build anomaly detection\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport json\n\n# Load historical build data\ndef load_build_data(filename):\n    with open(filename, 'r') as f:\n        data = json.load(f)\n\n    builds = []\n    for build in data:\n        builds.append({\n            'duration': build['duration'],\n            'file_count': build['output_files'],\n            'binary_size': build['output_size_bytes'],\n            'cpu_usage': build['avg_cpu_percent'],\n            'memory_usage': build['max_memory_mb'],\n            'network_calls': build['external_network_calls'],\n            'exit_code': build['exit_code']\n        })\n\n    return pd.DataFrame(builds)\n\n# Create anomaly detection model\ndef train_model(df):\n    model = IsolationForest(\n        contamination=0.05,  # Expect ~5% anomalies\n        random_state=42\n    )\n\n    # Train on numerical features\n    features = ['duration', 'file_count', 'binary_size', \n                'cpu_usage', 'memory_usage', 'network_calls']\n    model.fit(df[features])\n\n    return model, features\n\n# Detect anomalies in new builds\ndef detect_anomalies(model, features, historical_df, new_build):\n    # Convert new build to DataFrame with same structure\n    new_df = pd.DataFrame([new_build])\n\n    # Make prediction (1: normal, -1: anomaly)\n    prediction = model.predict(new_df[features])[0]\n\n    if prediction == -1:\n        # Find what's anomalous about this build\n        anomalies = []\n        for feature in features:\n            mean = historical_df[feature].mean()\n            std = historical_df[feature].std()\n            value = new_build[feature]\n\n            # If more than 3 standard deviations away, flag as anomalous\n            if abs(value - mean) &gt; 3 * std:\n                anomalies.append({\n                    'feature': feature,\n                    'value': value,\n                    'mean': mean,\n                    'std_dev': std,\n                    'std_deviations': abs(value - mean) / std\n                })\n\n        return True, anomalies\n\n    return False, []\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    # Load historical build data\n    historical_data = load_build_data('build_history.json')\n\n    # Train anomaly detection model\n    model, features = train_model(historical_data)\n\n    # New build to check\n    new_build = {\n        'duration': 128,\n        'file_count': 1892,\n        'binary_size': 15650432,\n        'cpu_usage': 82,\n        'memory_usage': 1245,\n        'network_calls': 17,  # Unusual, typically 0-2 for this build\n        'exit_code': 0\n    }\n\n    # Detect anomalies\n    is_anomaly, anomalies = detect_anomalies(model, features, historical_data, new_build)\n\n    if is_anomaly:\n        print(\"Anomalous build detected!\")\n        for anomaly in anomalies:\n            print(f\"Unusual {anomaly['feature']}: {anomaly['value']} \"\n                 f\"(typical: {anomaly['mean']:.2f} \u00b1 {anomaly['std_dev']:.2f}, \"\n                 f\"{anomaly['std_deviations']:.2f} standard deviations away)\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Build appears normal.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"tools/monitoring/#siem-solutions","title":"Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)","text":"CENTRAL MONITORING  SIEM solutions provide a centralized platform for collecting, correlating, and analyzing security events across the software supply chain.
