# Scanners for Software Supply Chain Security

In the realm of software supply chain security, utilizing the right scanning tools is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring the integrity of software components. This document reviews various tools that can be employed to scan for vulnerabilities within software supply chains.

## Types of Scanners

1. **Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Tools**
   - These tools analyze source code or binaries for vulnerabilities without executing the program. They help identify security flaws early in the development process.
   - Examples: SonarQube, Checkmarx, Fortify.

2. **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Tools**
   - DAST tools test applications in their running state, simulating attacks to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited in a live environment.
   - Examples: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Acunetix.

3. **Software Composition Analysis (SCA) Tools**
   - SCA tools focus on identifying vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies, which are often a significant risk in software supply chains.
   - Examples: Snyk, Black Duck, WhiteSource.

4. **Container Security Scanners**
   - These tools scan container images for vulnerabilities and compliance issues, ensuring that containers are secure before deployment.
   - Examples: Clair, Trivy, Aqua Security.

5. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Scanners**
   - IaC scanners analyze configuration files for cloud infrastructure to identify security misconfigurations and compliance violations.
   - Examples: Terraform Compliance, Checkov, TFLint.

## Best Practices for Using Scanners

- **Integrate Scanning into CI/CD Pipelines**: Ensure that scanning tools are part of the continuous integration and continuous deployment processes to catch vulnerabilities early.
- **Regularly Update Scanning Tools**: Keep scanning tools updated to ensure they can detect the latest vulnerabilities and threats.
- **Prioritize Findings**: Not all vulnerabilities are equally critical. Use risk assessment techniques to prioritize which vulnerabilities to address first.
- **Combine Different Types of Scanners**: Use a combination of SAST, DAST, and SCA tools for comprehensive coverage of potential vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

Selecting the right scanning tools and integrating them into the software development lifecycle is essential for maintaining a secure software supply chain. Regular scanning and proactive vulnerability management can significantly reduce the risk of security breaches.
