# Terminology in Software Supply Chain Security

## Key Terms

### Software Supply Chain
The entire process of software development, from initial design to deployment, including all components, dependencies, and third-party services involved.

### Dependency
A piece of software that another software component relies on to function. Dependencies can include libraries, frameworks, and other modules.

### Vulnerability
A weakness in a software component that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access or perform unauthorized actions.

### Threat Modeling
A structured approach to identifying and assessing potential threats to a system, allowing teams to prioritize security measures based on risk.

### Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
A comprehensive list of all components, including dependencies and their versions, that are included in a software product, used for transparency and security assessments.

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
A set of practices that enable development teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably by automating the integration and deployment processes.

### Artifact Signing
The process of digitally signing software artifacts to ensure their integrity and authenticity, verifying that they have not been tampered with during the delivery process.

### Secure Coding
The practice of writing code in a way that protects against vulnerabilities and security threats, following established guidelines and best practices.

### Monitoring
The ongoing process of observing and analyzing system behavior to detect and respond to security incidents in real-time.

### Standards
Established guidelines and best practices that organizations follow to ensure security and compliance in software development and supply chain management.

### Frameworks
Structured approaches or methodologies that provide a foundation for implementing security practices and processes in software development and supply chain management.
