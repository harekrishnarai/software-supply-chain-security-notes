## General Security Standards

### ISO/IEC 27001 {#isoiec-27001}

<div class="security-grid">
<div class="security-grid-item security-grid-item-main">
ISO/IEC 27001 is an international standard for information security management systems (ISMS). While not specifically designed for software supply chain security, it provides a comprehensive framework that can be applied to secure the various components of software supply chains.

#### Key Aspects for Supply Chain Security:

- **Annex A.14**: System acquisition, development and maintenance
- **Annex A.15**: Supplier relationships
- **Annex A.8**: Asset management (tracking dependencies)

#### Implementation Approach:
1. Conduct a risk assessment of your software supply chain
2. Develop security controls based on identified risks
3. Implement a continuous monitoring and improvement process
4. Seek certification through an accredited body
</div>

<div class="security-grid-item security-grid-item-side">
<div class="security-info-box">
<strong>Implementation Guidance</strong>
<ul>
<li>Begin with scope definition centered on supply chain elements</li>
<li>Develop specific controls for third-party code assessment</li>
<li>Establish explicit supplier security requirements</li>
<li>Create documentation for the verification of external components</li>
<li>Implement monitoring solutions for supply chain indicators</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework {#nist-csf}

<div class="security-grid">
<div class="security-grid-item security-grid-item-main">
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) provides a policy framework for private sector organizations to assess and improve their ability to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber attacks. The framework is structured around five core functions:

1. **Identify**: Develop an organizational understanding of risks to systems, assets, data, and capabilities
2. **Protect**: Implement safeguards to ensure delivery of critical infrastructure services
3. **Detect**: Implement activities to identify cybersecurity events
4. **Respond**: Implement activities to take action regarding detected cybersecurity events
5. **Recover**: Implement activities to maintain resilience and restore capabilities impaired by cybersecurity events

#### Application to Supply Chain Security:

The NIST CSF can be mapped to software supply chain security as follows:

- **Identify**: Inventory all software dependencies, build processes, and deployment pipelines
- **Protect**: Implement secure coding practices, dependency scanning, and artifact signing
- **Detect**: Deploy monitoring for unauthorized changes, suspicious build patterns, or compromised dependencies
- **Respond**: Establish protocols for addressing identified supply chain compromises
- **Recover**: Create backup systems and restoration procedures for clean rebuilds
</div>

<div class="security-grid-item security-grid-item-side">
<div class="security-info-box">
<strong>CSF Implementation Tiers</strong>
<p>Organizations can assess their maturity in supply chain security using the CSF tiers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tier 1 (Partial)</strong>: Ad-hoc processes, limited awareness</li>
<li><strong>Tier 2 (Risk Informed)</strong>: Risk management but not organization-wide</li>
<li><strong>Tier 3 (Repeatable)</strong>: Formal policies, integrated throughout the organization</li>
<li><strong>Tier 4 (Adaptive)</strong>: Continuous improvement, proactive security posture</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<th>Requirements</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Level 1</strong></td>
<td>Build process documentation</td>
<td>
  - Documentation of the build process<br>
  - Provenance available
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Level 2</strong></td>
<td>Tamper resistance</td>
<td>
  - Hosted build service with minimal security controls<br>
  - Requires source version control<br>
  - Generated provenance
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Level 3</strong></td>
<td>Build service security</td>
<td>
  - Security controls on build service<br>
  - Build as code (parameterized)<br>
  - Ephemeral environment with isolated builds
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Level 4</strong></td>
<td>Highest security assurance</td>
<td>
  - Two-party review of build configuration changes<br>
  - Hermetic builds (fully defined dependencies)<br>
  - Reproducible builds when possible
</td>
